# Welcome to Textio's frontend interview starter!

This is a React project with data preinstalled to support the interview problem. In `src/App.js`, you should see a pair of imports from [@textio/frontend-interview-data](https://github.com/textioHQ/frontend-interview-data): you'll use that data to support your solution, replacing what's currently rendered in `App.js`.

The project is run via vite (we tend to use yarn, npm, pnpm, and such should all work fine as well).

```shell
# Start the development server
yarn dev

# Run tests
yarn test
```
